abs() operator is used to eliminate the negative sign



mod() operator is used to find remainder 
	eg-> mod(5,2) which will be equal to 1



order by can have multiple attributes seperated with the comma(,) operator 
	The preference will be decided by the order of the order by 
		the attibute which is before comma is the first preference and if there is a conflict like two or more paramters having the same value
			then the table is ordered by second attribute i.e the attribute after comma(,)




use like operator if we have to find a table data which is starting from particular alphabet



SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city RLIKE '^[aeiou]' AND city RLIKE '[aeiou]$'
					             (start)		      (end)	
	the query will select the cities starting from one of  the 'aeiou' and ending with one of the 'aeiou'



select city from station where city NOT rlike '^[aeiou]' ;
	the query will select cities which don't have vowel at the beginning




select name from students where marks > 75 order by RIGHT(NAME,3) ,id
	the sorting happens between the last 3 digits and if there exists a name with same last 3 digits then sort them by ID




select round(12.3423,2)
	o/p->  12.34
		rounding off upto 2 decimals as mentioned in the query




P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) 
	The Manhattan distance between the P1 and P2 is (c-a)+(d-b) 





select pow(5,2) gives us 25 which is 5 square



 P1(a,c) P2(b,d)    are 2 points in 2d
	then Euclidean distance = sqrt(sqr(b-a) + sqr(d-c))




query to find the type of the triangle with the given sides
	select if(a+b>c and a+c>b and c+b>a,if(a=b and b=c,'Equilateral',if(a=b or b=c or a=c,'Isosceles','Scalene')),'Not A Triangle') from triangles




lower() -> to make a string lowercase
